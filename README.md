# UAV-Path-Planning with DFS Algorithm
# 基于深度优先搜索算法的无人机路径规划
This is a project using PCL in C++ to plan routes for drones.  
Data from 16-line Lidar are tested and DFS Algorithm are used in route planning.  
It is the first repo uploaded to Github and welcome to pull my project!  

## Introductions
This project takes it origin from an experiment of drones detection.  
With **Optical Camera, Infrared Camera, Millimeterwave Radar and Lidar**
In this part, we dealt with our **LIDAR** file and there are mainly 3 steps.
